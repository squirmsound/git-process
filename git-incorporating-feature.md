#### Incorporating a finished feature on develop
Finished features are to be merged into the `develop` branch so that they are added to the upcoming release:

```
$ git checkout develop

```
`...Switched to branch 'develop'`

```
$ git merge --no-ff myfeature
```

`...Updating ea1b82a..05e9557, `
`(Summary of changes)`

```
$ git branch -d myfeature
```

`...Deleted branch myfeature (was 05e9557)`

```
$ git push origin develop
```

The `--no-ff` flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature. Compare:

In the latter case, it is impossible to see from the Git history which of the commit objects together have implemented a featureâ€”you would have to manually read all the log messages. Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), is a true headache in the latter situation, whereas it is easily done if the --no-ff flag was used.

Yes, it will create a few more (empty) commit objects, but the gain is much bigger than the cost.
